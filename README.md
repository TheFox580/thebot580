# TheBot580
This is a fork of [Babagaboosh](https://www.github.com/DougDougGithub/Babagaboosh), changed as a bot for [TheFox580](https://www.twitch.tv/thefox580), [TheAlt580](https://www.twitch.tv/thealt580), [TheEvents580](https://www.twitch.tv/theevents580) and [LeRenard580](https://www.twitch.tv/lerenard580)

This code uses the TwitchIO Libraty, ElevenLabs' Text-To-Speech fonctionnality and PyGame's Audio Library.
It also acts as a moderator bot, as it contains a list of banned word in the chat, that will ban bots automatically.
